WDD 330 final project


Project Summary:

This final project is a self-directed effort designed to showcase the skills I have developed thus far in web development while also challenging myself to apply them in new ways. The project involves creating a website that provides information about different dog breeds. The site is intended to be a helpful resource for individuals who are considering adding a dog to their family and want to make an informed decision about which breed best suits their lifestyle. By building this project from the ground up, I am demonstrating my ability to design, structure, and implement a functional, user-friendly application that combines technical proficiency with practical utility.
